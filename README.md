# City Explorer

**Author**: Demie and Jonathan
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

**Problem domain**
Creating an app that helps tourist discover parts of Cambridge and the surrounding areas. 1. The user would like to search for a particular location. 2. The user would like a clear visual of these locations. 3. The user would like to have prompts if they have any issues.

**User Stories**

1.**Locations**: As a user of City Explorer, I want to enter the name of a location so that I can see the exact latitude and longitude of that location.

2.**Map**: As a user, I want to see a map of the city so that I can see the layout of the area I want to explore.

3.**Errors**: As a user, I want clear messages if something goes wrong so I know if I need to make any changes or try again in a different manner.
